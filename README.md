# Data Science and Machine Learning with Python

This repo is a collection of studies I'm doing in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning usin python. I'm going from the basics like statistics and linear algebra to more advanced topics. I will not go through some begginer topics like pandas and seaborn.

Warning: This is a sendbox repo, therefore there is a lot of libs that would normally be uncessary for a project.

## Repo Structure

- `kaggle_studies`: Some of the jupyter notebooks available by kaggle courses.
- `lib_basics`: A collection of jupyter for studying some advanced libs like jax.
- `mathematics`: A collection of jupyter notebooks for more profund math concepts and ml algorithms.
