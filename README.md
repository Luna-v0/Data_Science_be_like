# Data Science and Machine Learning with Python

This repo is a collection of studies I'm doing in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning using Python. I'm going from the basics like statistics and linear algebra to more advanced topics.

## ðŸ“š Knowledge Base Structure

This repository uses Obsidian for knowledge management. The structure is:

- `notes/` - Obsidian vault with concepts, MOCs, and documentation
  - `00-inbox/` - Quick capture for new ideas
  - `01-concepts/` - Core concepts organized by topic (linear algebra, calculus, statistics, ML)
  - `02-literature/` - Papers, articles, and book notes
  - `03-projects/` - Project documentation
  - `04-MOCs/` - Maps of Content (hub notes linking related concepts)
  - `templates/` - Note templates for consistent documentation
- `code/` - Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts
  - `notebooks/` - All Jupyter notebooks
  - `scripts/` - Python modules and standalone scripts
  - `experiments/` - Experimental code
- `data/` - Datasets (not tracked in git by default)
  - `raw/` - Original, immutable data
  - `processed/` - Cleaned and transformed data
  - `external/` - Data from external sources
- `assets/` - Images, PDFs, and other resources

### Using the Knowledge Base

1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Open this repository folder as a vault
3. Install recommended plugins:
   - **Obsidian Git** - Auto-backup to GitHub
   - **Obsidian Wypst** - Typst math rendering
   - **Dataview** - Query and organize notes
   - **Templater** - Note templates
   - **Excalidraw** - Drawing diagrams
   - **Advanced Tables** - Better table editing
4. Start with the MOCs in `notes/04-MOCs/`

### Linking Code and Concepts

Concepts in `notes/` link to implementations in `code/notebooks/`. Use the graph view to explore connections between theory and practice!

### Setup Instructions

See `obsidian-ml-spec.md` for detailed installation and configuration instructions.
