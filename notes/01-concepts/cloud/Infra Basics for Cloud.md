# Standard info
Some characteristics of cloud computing are: they are on-demand; they are accessed over the internet; multiple orgs can share the same infra and app while keeping its privacy and security; rapid elasticity and scalability; The org pay for the precise usage of the resource.

There are 3 types of cloud:
- **Private**: where the org has complete control, are used just by the organization, and not made public, normally used for niche business needs, it has more security sensitivity.
- **Public**: Resources are owned and operated by a provider over the internet. 
- **Hybrid**: Have parts of the whole infra in a public cloud and private cloud. 

# Advantages of using the cloud
In few words the cloud helps on: flexibility; cost-effectiveness; scalability; elasticity; availability; fault-tolerance and agility. Here are them more detailed.
- **OPEX over CAPEX**: The demand are trade from capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX), payed on-demand and reduced cost of ownership (TCO) and OPEX.
- **Massive scale**: Since AWS optimizes efficient for large scale, the prices are reduced from on-premise.
- **No overloading and underloading**: Most services can scale based on demand
- **Faster deployment**: There are a lot of services and pre defined architecture for using instead of having to build every single system and designing their optimized services.
- **No need for orgs to own a data center**
- **Globally deployment fast** 

# Types of Computing
**Usually** (not always) you can follow this rule:

## On-premise
You have to manage everything, from basic resources like networking and storage to the application layer.
## Infra as a Service (IaaS)
The idea is that the user does not have to manage simple infrastructure, normally IaaS are Virtual Machines, like [[AWS#Services#Basic|AWS EC2]].  
## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
It is for developing applications, all it gives you is a basic way to develop applications, there are a few variations of this like Container as a Service (CaaS), an example being [[AWS#Services#Basic|AWS ECS]] or Function as a Service (FaaS) an example being [[AWS#Services#Basic|AWS Lambda]]. Another example of PaaS are database services or other #ML services. 
## Software as a Service (SaaS)
Its a fully functional application, like Google Apps (Gmail, Docs, etc), Dropbox, Zoom, Slack, etc.
