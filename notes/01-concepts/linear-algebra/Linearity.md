# Definition
A linear function is not said exactly $f(x) = a dot x + b$ , but a function that follows two properties.

$$
f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b)
\ \ \
f(alpha a) = alpha f(a) 
$$

By definition we can show that:

$$
f(x + y) = a dot (x+alpha y) + b
\ = a dot x + a dot alpha y + b
\
\
f(x) + f(alpha y) = a dot x + a dot alpha y + b²
\ 
\
a dot x + a dot alpha y + b² != a dot x + a dot alpha y + b
$$

Some interest examples of True Linear functions is [[Integrals]]

# Linear composition
Composition of Linear functions can be reduced to a single Linear function.
