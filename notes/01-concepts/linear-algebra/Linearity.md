# Definition
A linear function is not said exactly $f(x) = a \cdot x + b$ , but a function that follows two properties.

$$
f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) \\
f(\alpha a) = \alpha f(a) 
$$

By definition we can show that:

$$
f(x + y) = a \cdot (x+\alpha y) + b \\
= a \cdot x + a \cdot \alpha y + b \\
\\
f(x) + f(\alpha y) = a \cdot x + a \cdot \alpha y + b^2 \\
\\
a \cdot x + a \cdot \alpha y + b^2 \neq a \cdot x + a \cdot \alpha y + b
$$

Some interest examples of True Linear functions is [[Integral]]

# Linear composition
Composition of Linear functions can be reduced to a single Linear function.

# Bi-linearity or N-linearity
A function of two or more elements are N-linear if all $n$ combination of the function are also Linear
