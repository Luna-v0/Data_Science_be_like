# Definition
A base vector is defined as a vector that follows a axis expressed as 1. Some examples are:
Base vectors are always [[Linear definitions#Linear Dependency|Linear Independent]] in relation to each other.

$$
hat(i) = vec(1,0,0,0) quad hat(j) = vec(0,1,0,0) quad hat(k) = vec(0,0,1,0) quad hat(w) = vec(0,0,0,1)
$$

# Identity Matrix
A identity matrix is a squared matrix that has each column (or row) as the column number base vector like this:

$$
I(4) = M(4,4) = mat(hat(i), hat(j), hat(k), hat(w))
$$

The Identity matrix has a special property of [[Matrix#Matrix multiplication|Matrix Multiplication]] and [[Types of Matrices#Inverse Matrix|Inverse Matrices]] that are:


$$
M(n,n)^(-1) dot M(n,n) = I(n)
\ \
M(n,n) dot I(n) = M(n,n)
$$
