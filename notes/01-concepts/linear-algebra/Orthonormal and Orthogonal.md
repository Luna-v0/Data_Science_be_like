# Orthogonal Vectors
Two vectors are said to be orthogonal to each other if their [[Internal Product]] or [[Vector#Dot product|Dot Product]] is zero. You can find a Orthogonal Vector using [[Vector#Cross Product]].

# Orthonormal Base

$V$ is a [[Vector Spaces|Vector Space]] with a [[Internal Product]] $f$ , a [[Linear definitions#Base|Base]] $\beta = \{ v_1 , v_2 , ... , v_n\}$ is orthogonal and each $v_i \in \beta$ is also a [[Unit Vector]]
