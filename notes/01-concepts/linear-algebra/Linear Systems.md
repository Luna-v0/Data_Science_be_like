# Definition
A Linear system can be defined as two [[Linearity|Linear]] equations. Those linear equations can be solved using [[Matrix#Matrix multiplication|Matrix Multiplication]]. Where you define like this:

$$
\begin{cases}
x+2y = 3 \\
4x+5y=6
\end{cases} \Leftrightarrow \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 4 & 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} 
$$

This is specially important to #ML since it can be used to define if your dataset has enough features / datapoints. 

A interesting view of solving systems using [[Matrix|Matrices]] is that the Matrix itself can be viewed as a encoding function of a different [[Base]] into [[Base vectors]].
