# Definition
A Linear system can be defined as two [[Linearity|Linear]] equations. Those linear equations can be solved using [[Matrix#Matrix multiplication|Matrix Multiplication]]. Where you define like this:

$$
cases(x+2y = 3, 4x+5y=6) <=> mat(1,2; 4,5) dot vec(x, y) = vec(3,6) 
$$

This is specially important to #ML since it can be used to define if your dataset has enough features / datapoints.
