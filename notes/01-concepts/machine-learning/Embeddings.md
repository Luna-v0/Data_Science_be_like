It is a mapping from [[Dataset#Datapoint|datapoint]] to a [[Vector]], basically mapping data to a [[Vector Spaces|Vector Space]]. This Vector Space is of high dimensionality, to be able to capture semantics, syntactic role, sentiment and correlation between different inputs. Another advantage of an embedding is that is easily searchable in [[Vector DB]]s, meaning you can make semantic search of text way easier.
